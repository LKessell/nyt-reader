## Planning Overview
This app was created as a test take-home challenge during Mod 4 at the Turing School of Software and Design. Due to the short timeframe of this project, planning was essential. I began by investigating the Top Stories API to see what information would be available to work with. After testing a few fetch calls, I began planning my app.

I started by taking a look at the New York Times site for inspiration. I liked the clean layout, and decided to pursue a similar look. I first created some wireframes, which can be (viewed here)[https://lkessell.invisionapp.com/freehand/NY-Times-Reader-tr6arI385].  

I also utilized a GitHub Projects board to keep track of my progress, and ensure that I was meeting MVP requirements for the challenge. I created user stories for MVP features, and utilized issues to track the completion of these features.
